## TODO
* make the bot responses replies
* response should be embed if it wants to share images and stuff... make a function for this
* summarize user context when it gets too large
* store summary in a db
* some way to share information? like share my info with corey?
* export into teams, slack, signal, telegram:w
* function to ping another member? later? (can you ask john to edit the powerpoint? but the llm can add a lot more details from the conversation)
* function to schedule a reply later (remind me to do x in 30 minutes) - then send the confirmation to the llm?

## DONE
* add dialyzer
* truncate longer responses to 2k characters or send as two messages
* change system prompt to be more general
